### Introduction

*Multi-attention Recurrent Network*(**MARN**) is a novel neural architecture, consisting of *Multi-attention Block*(**MAB**) and storing them in the hybrid memory of a recurrent component called the *Long-short Term Hybrid Memory*(**LSTHM**).

### Background

1. LSTHM is an extension of the Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) by reformulating the memory component to carry hybrid information.
